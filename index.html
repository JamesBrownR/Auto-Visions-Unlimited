I had paint correction and ceramic coating done, as well as a clear wrap on my black bars and the yellow reflectors blacked out. The transformation is incredible‚Äîmy car looks 10 times better than when I first bought it! Jake's attention to detail and expertise really shine through in his work. The finish is flawless, and I‚Äôm beyond impressed with the quality of service I received. If you're looking to enhance your vehicle's appearance, I highly recommend Auto Visions. I will definitely be back for future upgrades! Thank you, Jake!`},
  {name:"Kearlee Gregory", rating:5, text:`Great and quick work! I have leather seats and they get scorching hot during the summer, so I was referred here by a coworker and the work they did for my Volt is great! Everyone's really nice, helpful, and informative, too! Jake asked questions so they knew just how dark I wanted my windows tinted and I think they did a great job with it.`},
  {name:"James Steyer", rating:5, text:`You will not be disappointed! Auto Visions ceramic coated my entire truck. Protective wrapped the front end, hood, the lower portion of the sides (helps protect from rocks and such). Did a fantastic job! Since then I‚Äôve had to bring it in twice due to getting a couple scrap s down the side of the truck. Auto Visions buffed and polished them out and recoated that side. Came out perfect! If you want a job done well and friendly knowledgeable people to work with, go to Auto Visions Unlimited. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.`},
  {name:"Victoria Tiger", rating:5, text:`I recently got a new car and my back window accidentally got scratched. I called Jacob and he was so helpful. He recommend me come by his shop so he could get a better look at it to see if it was something he could fix. He did end up being able to buff out the scratch and didn't charge me. Jacob was extremely nice and a down to earth guy. We will be booking him in the future!!!!`},
  {name:"Mac Dongus", rating:5, text:`I recently got a Mazda CX5 tinted here and so far I am happy with everything. I am pretty picky when it comes to work on my car, but Jake does a good job of explaining and answering any of the questions I had. Jake also took the time to listen to me and ended up recommending me a tint percentage that I really like. I paid $540 to get all windows, including windshield, tinted. I will stick with this place for my future car needs.`},
  {name:"Jadon Dykes", rating:5, text:`I checked several other local tint shops. Each one would just give me the price quickly. Jake actually spent over 5 minutes with me on the phone discussing my options to make sure I was getting exactly what I was looking for. Not only are his prices competitive, but his customer service is outstanding. Thank you Jake and team! Not only does my car look "cooler" because of the tint, but she will be feeling cooler because of the ceramic tint as well!`},
  {name:"Tyler Maxwell", rating:5, text:`Wow is all I can say.. I have brought several of my vehicles to Jake and everytime he never ceases to amaze me! The amount of detail he puts into these cars is amazing. I am very picky and I can never find a spec of anything when I pickup my rides. Makes me not want to drive them. Highly highly recommend!`},
  {name:"Tanya Flock", rating:5, text:`The absolute best! All your specialties in one place and done to perfection. Scheduled details, ceramic coatings, paint protection, window tinting all done perfectly. Extremely knowledgeable and staff is very accommodating. We will always be a loyal customer.`},

  {name:"Natalie Goczoll", rating:5, text:`I went in for fresh tint on my new Jeep, and Jake and his team were absolutely wonderful. The quality of the tint and the price were more than fair, and they had me in and out in a timely manner. While I was there, I had a unfortunate situation of my battery dying in the shop- but they went above and beyond to make sure I was up and running before I left, checking everything to ensure it was good to go. They also offer a variety of services like car detailing and paint correction, which I definitely plan to return for. Such a great experience overall with a local shop- I couldn‚Äôt have asked for better service!`},
